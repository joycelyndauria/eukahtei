I was planning on including the February tweaks onto this month's roundup but this month took me hours to put this post together and I wasn't in the mood for it. To put it simply, March was an extremely busy month tweak wise. For starters, I had to split this post up into 2 parts as this post originally exceeds Reddits limit of 40000 characters. Over 180 new tweaks were released and many more were updated this month. This post is for those of you who are maybe on the fence about the iPad Mini, or just want more misc. details about it. The speakers are quite a bit worse than the cheap 2017/2018 iPad's. It's to be expected since it's smaller and thinner, but podcasts amp videos are a bit tinnier than I'd like. The cheaper 9.7" iPads pass my bar for "good enough" in reproducing voices, but that might just be because I'm more used to how it sounds. Probably not a problem for most people, and sound best RSS reader both on the Mac and on iOS devices with updated look (proper dark mode and automatic layout) and snappier feel.

Automatic decimal point in number entry. 2. Ability to filter transaction register on Attachments and Quicklook invoke with Space Bar. 3.

I don't know why or how to debug it! It isn't taking up a lot of resources, and I know it's neovim, because I can move the terminal around, it's just when I shrink or grow it, nothing gets updated.

We’ve added two Nintendo Game amp Watch titles this month: Fire (wide screen) and Snoopy Tennis.

As a PhD student, I am trying to set up my Academic reading/writing environment in Emacs since a few months back. Inspired by redguardtoo (https://github.com/redguardtoo/mastering-emacs-in-one-year-guide/blob/master/guide-en.org), I am using Purcell's configuration (https://github.com/purcell/emacs.d) as a foundation.

When the new IPad Pros were announced, I really was star struck by them. The hardware is top notch. It’s beautiful, fast, it has great speakers, and a spectacular display.

https://github.com/kmhofmann/selene (https://github.com/kmhofmann/selene) Selene is a C++17 image representation, processing, and I/O library, focusing on ease of use and a clean, modern, type-safe API. Since I last (https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/7xbft3/selene_a_c14_image_representation_processing_and/) posted here, almost a year ago, the library has seen an API redesign, a move to C++17, adding TIFF I/O support, and many smaller extensions and bug fixes.
