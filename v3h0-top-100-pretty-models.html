Lolita Playground Top List  Rank: Site: In: Out: 1: Tiny Model Mercedes Have you seen the new Mercedes Model ? Get Ready to Go Zero To 60 In Seconds. I’ve been daily driving Corvettes for the past (7) years or so. I had 5 years in an old C5 Corvette and spent the last two years in a C7 Grand Sport. While I love Corvettes my life has slowly become more complicated to the point where daily driving a C7 Grand Sport has been less and less of a joy. Now don’t get me wrong, Corvettes are the most daily-able sports cars you can get. Plenty of trunk room, an honest 30mpg if you drive them calmly, the cars are reliable, and they are generally affor. Going through old issues of the Wrestling Observer Newsletter and posting highlights in my own words. For anyone interested, I highly recommend signing up for the actual site at f4wonline ( and checking out the full archives. --- PREVIOUS YEARS ARCHIVE: 1991 (https://www.reddit.com/r/SquaredCircle/comments/4so8a9/wrestling_observer_rewind_12231991_final_post_for/) • 1992 (https://www.reddit.com/r/SquaredCircle/comments/51m67r/wrestling_observer_rewind_dec_28_1. A common complaint about this year's edition of The Show is that too many hard hit line drives turn into outs. The common response to this is "that's baseball." This got me wondering: are we getting "baseball'd" or are the complaints legitimate? This is a long post, you can skip to the conclusion if you want a TL;DR Hypothesis The hypothesis here is that the game accurately models the batted ball profiles, specifically the line drives, and that we're all complaining about some bad luck. 
Hi Reddit, I’m u/DeJeaNerates. I just want to say; if a fat, unmotivated and unattractive person like me can turn his life around then I’m sure you can as well! I’m currently 14 years old and last week, I got my first GF. Yes, really. Never have I thought that this day would come but it has and I want YOU to change like I did. Like many of you guys who are reading this, I’m a huge loser in school. I’m nerdy, overweight, average looking and it’s not like I have the best grades. Specifically to round up the new issues introduced or not fix in the Fallout 76: Wild Appalachia Patch – April 09, 2019 (https://bethesda.net/en/article/5hrHjCk5RTycypyr3ub4aQ/fallout-76-wild-appalachia-patch-notes-april-9-2019) # Armor / Worn Equipment: #Helmets / Cosmetic Items Issue: Multiple Reports of Cosmetic Items suddenly have a durability Bar and being impossible to repair. (Ticket Submitted on 04-10-2019) Trying to find the original post I saw involving a Fasnacht. I think we should see at this point is a 30%-40% culling of the summoning pool. In each area 3 star, 4 star, and 5 star there are so many units left in the pool that do nothing but make players unhappy when they are pulled. What I'd like to see is a classic pool created that these units move to. You could still bring the banner around monthly make it a cheaper step up and let us do traditional Lapis and ticket summons on it if anyone wants those old units. amp#x200B; I'm sure you could. Since Richard Lewis still can't stop talking about the subreddit and causing trouble (most recently bringing it up on stream just a couple of minutes ago) it’s time to break the principle that we don’t talk about content bans publicly. In this post I will address the lies that he keeps spreading in order to show once and for all that this entire thing is utterly ridiculous. I will go through his recent video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0z1I_WUfaU) segment by segment and address the specif. 
I think it´s time I invested time in writing a little essay about how I went from a sad, loveless addict to a healthy, happy individual with abundance in my life. I took so much advice from this subreddit in the beginning and I want to give something back. The only way I know how is to try to convey some of the information that helped me, and some other information I wish I had access to at my beginning. This is going to be long as I am going to cover my story, what I did to change I read so many great post on here with ideas for future fifas only to get shot down by so many of us with this one line, ‘that won’t make EA money so they’ll never do that’. Which I 100% agree with. Look at every other mode besides FUT. Hell even look at FUT. How much content actually gets added each year? Sure we’ll see some slick promo video from EA featuring some new tech which will either be used very little (no touch dribbling) or some new mechanic that hasn’t been thoroughly tested Hi all, One of the things I am loving more than anything in the Division 2 is how the gear game for PVE is so intricate. Even without the addition of 6 piece gear sets we have so many talents and items to work with, that we are really only limited by our creativity. Now me personally, I am an every kind of activity player. I love my solo sessions, however I also love getting a group together for those really intense fights with enemies coming from every angle. What can get hard is trying Since the new the update I've been looking into all the new things. I haven't been able to play enough multiplayer yet to form a solid opinion on anything so this is mostly about the campaign, though I will include some thoughts on multiplayer. Also since this is mostly about the campaign, I'm not really going to bother deciding whether something is OP or not, because that's subjective. Instead I'll just weigh things based on how they fit into their faction and the Lore, and how they effect. I decided to step my toes into Weidian (3 things from this list are from there) - honestly with some good results! The Diorquake definitely was a little disappointing, but I took a risk and very impulsively bought it. I love the re/done jeans and t-shirt I got. I normally wear a 26 in jeans and got these in a 27 to be safe and they're maybe a touch too big. The shirt is a great fit. So I recommend everyone take the Weidian plunge!! PART I: TAOBAO LIFE LESSONS So in regard to clothing. Back in January, I decided to do something about the lack of data everyone keeps talking about regarding shuffler complaints. Three weeks ago in mid March, I posted on reddit (https://www.reddit.com/r/MagicArena/comments/b21u3n/i_analyzed_shuffling_in_a_million_games/) about my results, to much ensuing discussion. Various people pointed out flaws in the study, perceived or real, and some of them I agree are serious issues. Perhaps more importantly, the study was incomplete - I tested whether. Hey guys, I started noticing some of you guys are PMing me more and more often regarding Monaco and the tickets/grandstands for the F1 GP therefore I decided to write up some lines that I hope may help you in your choice. For an optimal viewing experience of this post I recommend you downloading the free Chrome or Firefox extension Imagus . Notice I am in no way affiliated to F1 or any ticketing site anymore therefore you won’t find any affiliate links or referrals or whatever. The internet is a very unhealthy echo chamber of ignorance for several reasons: 1. The existence of loud, uneducated and angry people. 2. The fact that the overwhelming majority of people never post on the internet. 3. The fact that among that majority, more of them will choose to post if they experience a failure. 4. The fact that there is a potential personal and financial gain for the owners of MBPs. # False numbers and statistics There is admittedly no direct statistics available </p>
