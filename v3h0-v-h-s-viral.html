                            <p> I had heard it was the worst of the series, but I hadn't expected it to be such a drop off in quality. The first film had the best wrap around plot, the second the best shorts, but the 3rd has no redeeming features. The wrap around plot is barely coherent and makes very little sense. The straightforward element of some people finding a stack of creepy VHS tapes in the first movie has been replaced by a lazy attempt some sort of edgy commentary on internet videos. An iam14andthisisdeep versio. So, since I just finished watching the third one I figured we could talk about which segments we liked and disliked. Likes: gt Amateur Night gt The Sick Thing That Happened to Emily When She Was Younger gt A Ride in the Park gt Safe Haven gt Dante the Great gt Bonestorm Meh: gt 10/31/98 gt Phase I Clinical Trials gt Parallel Monsters Hated: gt Tuesday the 17th gt Second Honeymoon gt Slumber Party Alien Abduction How about. I enjoyed the first two entries. Scattershot, no doubt, but the premise is good and superior entries such as Phase I: Clinical Trials, Amateur Night and Safe Haven elevate it. I've heard Viral is toilet. Is it just the strength of the entries 
Did anyone else find this movie completely bs? I liked the previous ones, a lot. But this one seemed totally phoned. So I saw the first two and they were good. Really scary and made me jump and get totally creeped out. This one was hard to follow and the stories weren't even that good. Disappointing. here's the official trailer for vhs viral (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZMebnH0mgA). im getting excited. I loved v/h/s and v/h/s/2 even more so. my only hope is that they rename it v/h/s/3 for consistencies sake. can't. Being a big fan of the first two I was honestly shocked that they could get this one so incredibly wrong. The only interesting "tape" was the last one and even that one was pretty bad. Opinions. 
After watching this movie I was very confused; even more so than after watching the first two. Does Viral tie in with the plot of the other two movies? ` What's with the taxi clip? What the heck is that blimp? WHAT is up with the van?? I have only vague explanations for all these things, so discussion about them would be appreciated. Thanks. Note: "V/H/S: Viral" was released to VOD on October 23, 2014 and will have limited theatrical release on November 21, 2014. As such, the film has yet to receive ratings on Rotten Tomatoes or Metacritic. --- Synopsis: Follows fame-obsessed teens who unwittingly become stars of the next internet sensation. Directors: Nacho Vigalondo, Marcel Sarmiento, Gregg Bishop, Justin Benson, and Todd Lincoln Writers: Nacho Vigalondo, Marcel Sarmiento, Gregg Bishop, Justin Benson, Todd Linco. Just watched the third of the V/H/S series and it's dumb and terrible and stupid and please don't watch this film! In the last two V/H/S films, I found at least one segment I liked, but in this one, I honestly can't recommend a single one. The only one that comes close to being good is the first segment Dante the Great, but I'd only classify that as Okay. The writing is lazy, the scares are not even scares, the acting is atrocious and the stories are fucking dumb. Wraparound story: So, I just finished watching V/H/S: Viral on iTunes. Here's a very quick review for those interested. Also, for the sake of perspective, I loved the first two films: 1. Vicious Circles - This is the narrative frame that's supposed to tie the segments together. It has it's moments but, for the most part, it's just a mess and doesn't do a very good job of tying everything together. 2. Dante the Great - I loved this segment. Great story, well-paced, incredible VFX. This is probably Looking for all 3 of the following movies: V/H/S (2012) V/H/S/2 (2013) V/H/S Viral (2014) 720p or 1080p would be preferable, but not required, although an HD version is a requirement. So Reddit, The new third installment of V/H/S is out, "V/H/S: Viral". In it, there's mention of the domain "NutlessWonders.com" - which I now own, what do I do with it? (Like most domains that get mentioned in films, I tried visiting it - and to my great surprise no one had actually bought the domain, so I got online and bought. I'm a huge fan of the V/H/S franchise, and the first two are honestly some of my favorite horror films of this decade so far. I finally got a chance to watch Viral, and wow am I disappointed. First, I just want to make sure I understood the actual plot, because it was pretty confusing. So in the wraparound, we have a police chase with this runaway ice cream truck. The truck is broadcasting a bunch of the VHS tapes, some from previous films in addition to the three we're watching in Viral.
